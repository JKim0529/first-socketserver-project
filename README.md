## Test
###### This project is collaborated with socket-server and docker with the base of python. 
Python is quite simple to start, and there are many different modules that can connect with Python
Socketserver can also connect with Arduino by implementing arduino Firmata to the server part of socket server
Docker can keep all the source codes and packages in one image stored in the container, 
which can help running applications in several different conditions.
